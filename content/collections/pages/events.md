The destinations may be familiar, but the routes to get there and back won't be! Our ride-outs team aim to provide a motorcycle-friendly route on each run: save the highways for the cars!"

During BST, we operate on Monday evenings; during GMT we operate on Saturday mornings. New and existing members are welcome to attend these events to further their progression - never stop learning!"

These events are a great opportunity to meet with likeminded individuals outside of the riding/training aspect of the group.'
